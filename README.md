# MIPS_32bit_Multi_Cycle_Processor
MIPS multi cycle processor (32 bit) has been designed and simulate to understand the basic operation of computer processor. Some basic instructions those are ADD, SUB, AND, OR, LW, SW, SLT, BEQ, BNQ, JUMP, JR, SLL, SLTI &amp; LUI have been implemented. It is design by using Verilog HDL and simulate on Vivado tool.
